			<ol id="tip-list">
				<li>
					Always use a unique password for each account you create. The danger with reusing passwords is that
					as soon as one site has a security issue, it‘s very easy for hackers to try the same username and
					password combination on other websites.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don’t use any personally identifiable information in your passwords. Names, birthdays, and street
					addresses may be easy to remember but they’re also easily found online and should always be avoided
					in passwords to ensure the greatest strength.
				</li>
				<li>
					Make sure your passwords are at least <b>12 characters</b> long and contain letters, numbers, and
					special characters. Some people prefer to generate passwords which are <b>14 or 20</b> characters in
					length.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you’re creating a master password that you’ll need to remember, try using phrases or lyrics from
					your favorite movie or song. Just add random characters, but don't replace them in easy patterns.
				</li>
				<li>
					Use a password manager like LastPass to save your passwords. We keep your information protected from
					attacks or snooping.
				</li>
				<li>Avoid weak, commonly used passwords like <b>asd123</b>, password1, or Temp!. Some examples of a strong
					password include: <b>S&2x4S12nLS1*</b>, <b>JANa@sx3l2&s$</b>, <b>49915w5$oYmH.</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					Avoid using personal information for your security questions, instead, use LastPass to generate
					another “password" and store it as the answer to these questions. The reason? Some of this
					information, like the name of the street you grew up on or your mother’s maiden name, is easily
					found by hackers and can be used in a brute-force attack to gain access to your accounts.
				</li>
				<li>
					Avoid using similar passwords that change only a single word or character. This practice weakens
					your account security across multiple sites.
				</li>
				<li>
					Change your passwords when you have reason to , such as after you've shared them with someone, after
					a website has had a breach, or if it's been over a year since you last rotated it.
				</li>
				<li>
					You should never share your passwords via email or text message. The secure way to share is with a
					tool like LastPass that gives you the ability to share a hidden password and even revoke access when
					the time comes.
				</li>
